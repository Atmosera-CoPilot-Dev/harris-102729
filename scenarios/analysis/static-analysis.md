# Static Analysis

## Java

Recommend Java static analysis tools that can produce SARIF reports and be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. The tool(s) should be able to detect security vulnerabilities in Java code and bytecode. 

What are the steps to configure and generate a SARIF report using Java analyzers (Maven/Gradle plugins or CLI tools) for a Java project? 

How do I upload the SARIF output from my CI workflow so findings appear in GitHub's Security > Code scanning?

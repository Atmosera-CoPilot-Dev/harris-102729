## UML Diagram Request
```markdown
I want a UML class diagram for an invoicing system with classes for Invoice, Client, and InvoiceItem. Include attributes and methods for each class. Show the relationships between the classes (e.g., associations, aggregations, compositions) using appropriate UML notation. The format should be in a human-readable visualization format (picture layout)

## Designing a Web-Based Invoicing Application with Java 
```markdown
My team consists of experienced Java backend developers. I need step-by-step guidance to design a web-based invoicing application with the following requirements:

1. Build a RESTful API for managing invoices and clients.
2. Use MongoDB (NoSQL) for data storage.
3. Implement invoice management logic for adding/removing invoice items and clients.
4. Generate billing and ageing reports.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for invoice management (Angular).
6. Set up secure authentication and authorization.
7. Implement robust error handling and logging.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend tools, frameworks, and libraries for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies for each step.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.
- Add diagrams or architecture visuals if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.
- Don't include any sample code.
- Recommend testing strategies and tools for both backend and frontend.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Enable my team to confidently execute each phase of the invoicing application project with a clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security using Java (Spring Boot) and Angular.

```markdown
I am an experienced software engineer and would like an overview how GitHub Copilot can be integrated into the software development life cycle. 
- Provide a detailed explanation of how Copilot can assist in each phase of the SDLC, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Include specific examples of tasks or activities within each phase where Copilot can be particularly beneficial.

I want a UML class diagram for an invoicing system with classes for Invoice, Client, and InvoiceItem. Include attributes and methods for each class. Show the relationships between the classes (e.g., associations, aggregations, compositions) using appropriate UML notation. The format should be in a human-readble visualization format (picture layout)
